    "Problem: Suppose you are making an experiment in which you will get 2 number combinations. You are\n",
    "given 12 ping pong balls with two different colors (yellow and white), each colored ball is\n",
    "numbered 1 to 6. Create a flowchart in which you will release 2 numbered balls, 1 of each color,\n",
    "randomly, 6 times maximum. You are also given 3 colored baskets (yellow, red and white). If the\n",
    "number in each ball is the same, should go to red. If the product of two balls released is even, the\n",
    "ball should go to white basket, if odd then to yellow.\n",
